## Simulated-Universe Native Client
This is a repository to show how a native client for the Simulated-Universe environment may look.
It is based on the SDL2 library as a cross-platform library to access all needed components.


To keep track on the object model StarUML is used. The simulated-universe code generator then creates some of the structures and makefiles.


In a first attempt it only will build on Linux based systems. Eventually it should run on all systems that are supported by the SDL and have at least a OpenGL interface for rendering.

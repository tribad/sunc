## Simulated-Universe Native Client
This is a repository to show how a native client for the Simulated-Universe environment may look.
It is based on the SDL2 library as a cross-platform library to access all needed components.

To keep track on the object model StarUML is used. The simulated-universe code generator then creates some of the structures and makefiles.
